# Key Bindings

Keybindings are an essential aspect of Dirent that significantly enhance your efficiency and speed while navigating and managing files. This section provides comprehensive information about the keybinding system in Dirent, including the base keymap options and the flexibility to customize keybindings according to your preferences.

#### Base Keymap Options

When you launch Dirent, you have the choice to select a base keymap style that matches your familiarity with other file management applications. You can always change this selection later in app Settings. The available options are:

1. **Finder:** The Finder keymap is ideal for users who are accustomed to macOS's Finder application. It offers keybindings that mirror the keyboard shortcuts commonly used in Finder for file navigation and management.
2. **Commander (Total Commander):** This keymap option is tailored for users who are familiar with the keyboard shortcuts in file managers like Total Commander. It includes keybindings resembling those found in these traditional file management tools.
3. **Code:** This keymap option is designed for users accustomed to code editors and integrated development environments (IDEs). It incorporates keybindings commonly used in programming environments to streamline navigation and manipulation of files.

**Accessing Keybindings Preferences**

To customize keybindings, navigate to the "Settings" menu and look for a tab called "Key Bindings".

**Adjusting Keybindings:** To change a key binding, select the command you wish to modify and double-click or right-click. Then choose "Assign." Next, use your preferred key gesture and click "Assign" to confirm. Keep in mind that some key gestures are reserved by the system and are not allowed. If you select a key gesture that is already assigned to another command, it will be removed from the other command.

**Removing Keybinding :** If you want to remove a key binding from a command, right-click and choose "Remove."

Resetting Keybinding: If you want to reset a key binding for a command, right-click and choose "Reset." It will reset the key binding to the default one from the current keymap.

Resetting to Defaults: If at any point, you wish to return to the original keybindings, click the "Reset" icon on the top-right of the dialog.\
