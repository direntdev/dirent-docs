# Permissions (MacOS AppStore)

Dirent operates entirely offline, ensuring all your data remains on your computer. For the app to navigate through folders effectively, certain permissions are necessary.

### Folders

You have control over which folders Dirent can access. If you try to access a folder outside the specified range, the app will notify you that it cannot read these locations. For the best experience, it's recommended to select the root folder ("/"). This allows for seamless navigation throughout your entire file system.

### Full Disk Access

Granting this permission is optional and needed only for accessing certain system folders like Trash, Mail, and Safari, which require special permissions. If you wish for Dirent to operate within these folders, you need to manually enable this permission. Go to MacOS System Settings, then navigate to Privacy & Security -> Full Disk Access, and toggle the setting for Dirent.
